Competitive programming is similar to quiz contests. Here a team or individual is given a number of mathematical and logical problems to solve using any programming language allowed by the host. The competition can span from just a few hours to even months. The categories of problems cover many mathematical concepts like data structures, graphs, number theory, dynamic programming, string processing, algebra, geometry and much more. The competitions take place online – on both local and global networks. The team that solves the most problems earliest with the least erroneous submissions wins. There can also be other criteria of point distribution such as the efficiency of the algorithm, size of the code and many more.

Training and taking part in programming contests make you more and more disciplined, faster and focused coder.

In the competition, you must solve problems in stressful situations and do it up against a deadline or you will lose.
Taking part in competitive programming teaches you how to be more focused on the task and not only complete it quickly,
but accurately. These skills are highly beneficial for any job, not just in coding.

O que eu ganho participando das maratonas de programação?
As maratonas são ótimas para ajudar você a treinar a mente a resolver problemas no menor tempo possível, com a
menor quantidade de erros. Ajudam a desenvolver o trabalho em grupo na busca por uma solução.

De brinde, você conhece melhor as linguagens de programação, aprende mais algoritmos, treina o inglês, aprende 
a otimizar o uso da máquina, e ainda por cima se dive
